# GitAhead
Today I discovered a new Git Client today, [GitAhead](https://gitahead.github.io/gitahead.com/), which is open source, free to use and integrates with both Github and Gitlab. I'll start to use it for Linux instead of [Fork](https://git-fork.com), which unfortunately is only available for Mac and Windows.

Hopefully, I'll be able to use it across all 3 platforms for development!
